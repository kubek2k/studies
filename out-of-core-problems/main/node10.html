Processing big meshes</A>

<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">Polygonal meshes acquired with modern scanning technology can easily reach hundreds of millions of triangles which gives many GB data size.
There exist special approaches to processing such large meshes, which sizes often exceeds 4GB address space of 32-bit machines.
Those approaches may be divided into few groups [<A
 HREF="node16.html#mesh">10</A>]:
</SMALL>

<UL>
<LI>mesh cutting - original mesh is cut into smaller parts, small enough to fit entirely in memory.
	Then algorithm analyses each part independently.
	Despite the simplicity of this approach, the initial cutting step can be expensive when the input mesh is given in an indexed representation. 
	Unfortunately mesh cutting typically lowers the quality of the output and there might be some problems with processing cut boundaries.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>batch processing - stream the data through main memory in one or more passes.
	Of course computations are restricted to the amount of data actually resident in memory at any time.
	This makes batch processing a very efficient approach.
	Using this approach there can be done mesh simplification process, which batch-process the input mesh as a sequence of individual triangles.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>online processing - access the data through a series of queries.
	Data should be initially re-organised to avoid costly disk seeks with each query.
	Also queries can be accelerated by caching or pre-fetching data that is likely to be accessed.
	This way we can just use the virtual memory functionality provided by the operating system, but the performance of such algorithm is os-dependant.
	And of course as we seen before, there are some problems with the use of virtual memory for out-of-core algorithms.
	We can also use many data structures which give us possibility to use traditional in-core algorithms in large data sets (ie. octree).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>processing sequence - access to mesh is restricted to fixed traversal order while supporting access to full connectivity and geometry information for the active elements of this traversal.
	This approach combines efficiency of batch processing with the advantage of explicit mesh connectivity that is available in online processing.
	Generating processing sequences can be done in numerous ways, ie. from a out-of-core compression method which naturally generate triangles and vertex ordering suitable as the processing sequence.
