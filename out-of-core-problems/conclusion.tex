Input/Output communication between fast internal memory and slower external memory seems to be a major bottleneck in many large-scale applications.
Recently, several external memory techniques have been developed for a wide variety of computer problems to overcome this problem.
This work has had significant impact given that in recent years there has been a rapid increase in the raw size of datasets.
We can see that more and more computer research focuses on developing out-of-core (and often cache-friendly) techniques.
This paper reviewed fundamental issues and presented in-depth study of some common out-of-core algorithms developed in recent years.
Its major goal was to provide students some general information of out-of-core problems.
