lip environment</A>
</H2><SMALL CLASS="SMALL">
One of OOC libraries on which I want to concern is lip. [<A
 HREF="node16.html#kzajac">13</A>] 
It was made as a utility able to help in solving Irregular <A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot364"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN></SUP></A>simulations and Out of Core problems.
It is based on MPI-IO, so it can be ported on any system: from SMP machine to simple workstation.
It has three interesting features helping in more efficient use of parallel machines:
</SMALL>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Reusing communication schedule - in lip we are able to construct objects called communication patterns, which are responsible for managing sending and suspending data from memory.
	We can do it in phase called ,,inspector phase'', and therefore the I/O delays are a bit minimalized ( as the data are coming while the other are being processed ).
</LI>
<LI>Data caching- which is especially used in computing OOC problems. Additionally the I/O latency is minimized by derived data attributes, that makes as able to read one non-contignous burst of data per only one MPI-IO routine. 
</LI>
<LI>Scalability - the number of processors doesn't matter ( in spite of CHAOS which needed <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.png"
 ALT="$2^n$"></SPAN> ).

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">OOC index-arrays problems are done by dividing data for i-sections and referencing globals to the local nodes.
It's done by multiple use of Localize() method which is done in the so called Inspector phase.
Every node receives the same portion of data and processes it. 
The global chunks are treated almost like the local ones.
The only difference is in gathering data ( we have to perform request for new data ).
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">Sometimes problem grows a bit and also data arrays becomes OOC.
That is little more complicated as the Inspector phase ( from the first case ) is insufficient, because some data could be unreachable, as their index exists only in the disk memory.
These problems could be solved using another optimization - it should concern not only on communication but also on I/O access. 
It's kind of trick and is done by examining and translating references between disk and the memory.
Calling ooc_localize() we can be sure that lip will make everything for us.
</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL CLASS="SMALL">After such a examination and translation the computing can be done using simple MPI procedures.
